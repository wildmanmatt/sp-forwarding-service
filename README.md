# SparkPost Forwarding Service

A small Heroku service that will consume inbound message webhook POSTs and
forward them through the Transmissions API to a mailbox.

## Deployment

Start by clicking on the following button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)][deploy]

Once the deployment completes click on the "View" button under "Your app was
successfully deployed". (Alternatively browse to
`https://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com/index.html`.)

If a `FORWARD_FROM` address was chosen other than the default
`forward@sparkpostbox.com` then a sending domain will need to be
[created][createsd] and verified. To get to the SparkPost UI browse to the
"Resources" tab of the newly created app in the [Heroku Dashboard][apps], and
then click "SparkPost".

## Deploying Manually

1.  Register for an account with [Heroku][signup] and install the Heroku
    [Toolbelt][toolbelt] for your operating system. Then log in:

        heroku login

2.  Clone the repository and install:

        git clone git@github.com:SparkPost/sp-forwarding-service.git
        cd sp-forwarding-service
        npm install

3.  Create the heroku app:

        heroku create

4.  Configure the required add-ons:

        heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev
        heroku addons:create sparkpost:free

    Note: The SparkPost add-on will automatically create a SparkPost account and
    set up the appropriate key. If you already have an account and wish to use
    that do not run the `addons:create sparkpost:free` command. Then set the
    following config var:

        heroku config:set SPARKPOST_API_KEY=<your-api-key-here>

5.  Configure the app:

        heroku config:set FORWARD_FROM=<the-from-address-to-use>
        heroku config:set FORWARD_TO=<the-recipient-of--forward-messages>

6.  Deploy the app:

        git push heroku master

7.  Complete the setup by browsing to the following page:
